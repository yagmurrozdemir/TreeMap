# TreeMap

Tree map is a scapegoat tree based map implementation that keeps its entries sorted according to the
natural ordering of their keys. Tree maps are used to store data in key:value pairs. A tree map
is a collection which is ordered (i.e., the entries have a defined order and that order will not change),
changeable (i.e., we can update, add or remove entries after the tree map has been created) and do
not allow duplicates (i.e., tree maps cannot have two entries with the same key).
Tree map entries are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the keys.
